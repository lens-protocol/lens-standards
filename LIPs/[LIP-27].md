## Abstract

<
  The Lens Algorithm Marketplace enables users to monetize their content and allows third parties to sell curated feeds to users. LIP-26 proposes a primitive where users can bring their own feeds to a client and switch between them. This primitive introduces a new category of marketable assets. Instead of clients extracting value from users with their own algorithms, users can now create and sell access to their own content to algorithm curators. The marketplace fosters competition among users, clients, and third-party organizations in curating content for mutual benefit rather than exploiting users.
>

## Motivation

<
  This LIP aims to create a marketplace for User-Owned Fees Tokens (UOFs) to be built. In this marketplace, users can delegate an "agent" who based on data from the user fills their feed with desirable or profitable content proposed by 3rd party curators. This allows users to earn from their ownership of UOFs, or utilize distribution by third parties to other users, as well as control how their feed is generated. By introducing a free-market approach to content curation, users can potentially benefit from algorithms that currently exploit them in today's social media landscape.

## Specification

<
  The Lens Algorithm Marketplace aims to support the sale or rental of algorithm generation processes and content inclusion to UOFs. It should enable users, clients, third parties, and agents running algorithms to buy, rent, or sell their 
content curation to User-Owned Feeds (UOFs) on the blockchain. Transactions should be settled via smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Essentially, it should serve as an open marketplace where any entity can engage in various forms of trade and curation. 

>

## Rationale

<
  Simply put, the Lens Algorithm Marketplace aims to commoditize content curation for User-Owned Feeds (UOFs).
