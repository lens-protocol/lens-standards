## Abstract

<
Every User-Owned Feed (UOF) will generate specific content for a user based on the posts and preferences inscribed in its metadata. This means that the content viewed by the user is determined by what is defined in the UOF's metadata on all apps that use a particular UOF (note: a user might have multiple UOF's for differenct types of apps). The Lens Algorithm Marketplace enables the trading of inclusion of posts in a users feed. However, it also introduces an opportunity to commoditize the content within the UOF itself, known as "feedspace". This refers to the ability for users to profit from the inclusion of posts in their UOFs.

## Motivation

<!--
User-Owned Feeds (UOFs) have the potential to be a decisive factor distinguishing Web3 platforms from traditional social media. By commoditizing the metadata within UOFs, we can level the playing field for apps who lack the resources needed to compete in today's sophisticated algorithm-driven environment. Instead of optimizing content purely to appease algorithms, creators can concentrate on producing high-quality content to foster growth, leveraging the ability to purchase feed space within UOFs and for algorithm generators to reward content in a less clear way. This shift allows for a more equitable opportunity for all creators to thrive based on content quality rather than algorithmic manipulation.
-->

## Specification

<!--
The availability of feed space should be determined by the owner of the User-Owned Feeds' (UOF) agent, or actor that is generating the inscriptions of the users feed though an algorithm with the users delegation. An agent can determine what can or cannot be included in a users feed based on a users preferences and market conditions. A user should have the ability to override an agent through forced inclusion or exclusion on their app. An agent filling a users feedspace must workwithin the metadata standards of a UOF and can be undelegated by a user that wishes to switch agents (even if this is to themselves).

-->

## Rationale

<!--
The purpose of this LIP is to enhance users' ownership of their social media experience. User-Owned Feeds (UOFs) empower users to control the content they see in their feeds. The Lens Algorithm Marketplace facilitates the trading of these UOAs in a competitive market, aiming to generate advantages for users. Additionally, the concept of feed space enables users and creators to gain financial or social benefits through the inclusion of curated content in users' feeds.
